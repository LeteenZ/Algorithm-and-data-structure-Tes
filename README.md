# Algorithm and Data Structure Test

This repository contains a project for testing algorithms and data structures, specifically focusing on a **Doubly Linked List** implementation in C++. The source code can be found in the file [Bai_tap_lon.cpp](Bai_tap_lon.cpp).

## Features

- **Initialize the List**: Set up an empty doubly linked list.
- **Add Node**: Add a new node with a given value at the end of the list.
- **Remove Node**: Remove the last node from the list.
- **Display List**: Show the entire list or display it in reverse order.
- **Count Nodes**: Count the number of nodes in the list.
- **Sort List**: Sort the list using different algorithms:
  - Selection Sort
  - Bubble Sort
  - Insertion Sort
- **Quick Sort & Heap Sort (Coming Soon)**

## Usage

### Entering a List

When prompted, enter the number of elements you want in the list and their values. The list will be displayed after it is created.

### Sorting

Choose from the available sorting algorithms to sort the list in descending order.

### Removing Nodes

Remove the last node in the list using the appropriate menu option.

## Installation

To compile and run the program:

1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., g++).
2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   g++ -o doubly_linked_list Bai_tap_lon.cpp
